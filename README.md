Forecasting US GDP using Time Series Models

This repository contains code and documentation for a project focused on forecasting the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) of the United States using various time series models. The goal of the project is to develop accurate predictions of future GDP values based on historical data.

Overview:
Data Source: 
The quarterly GDP data of the United States was obtained from the Kaggle website. The dataset covers the period from 2003 to 2022.

Analysis:
The project analyzes the data to identify trends, seasonality, and patterns. Various time series models were implemented and evaluated for their forecasting performance.

Models: 
Three main types of models were explored:
Auto ARIMA (Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average)
Holt-Winters Model
Regression Models with different trends and seasonality components

Steps Taken:
Define the Goal: The objective is to predict future GDP values accurately, considering both trend and seasonality components.

Data Acquisition: The GDP dataset was sourced from Kaggle, covering quarterly data from 2003 to 2022.

Exploration and Visualization: The data was explored visually to identify trends and seasonality.

Data Preprocessing: Missing values were handled, and the focus was narrowed to the past 20 years for analysis.

Partitioning the Data: The dataset was divided into training and validation sets for model evaluation.

Modeling and Evaluation: Various models were implemented and evaluated, including ARIMA, Holt-Winters, and Regression models.

Forecasting: The best-performing model (Auto ARIMA) was used to forecast future GDP values for the next several quarters.

Model Selection: Based on performance metrics such as MAPE and RMSE, the Auto ARIMA model was selected as the preferred model for forecasting US GDP.

Files:
Code: Contains R scripts for data preprocessing, modeling, and forecasting.
Data: Contains the GDP dataset used for analysis.

Results: 
Contains visualizations, forecasts, and evaluation metrics for each model.

Conclusion:
The Auto ARIMA model demonstrated the best forecasting performance among the models evaluated, with low MAPE and RMSE values. This model is recommended for predicting future US GDP values.
